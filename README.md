# GymPass-style App

This is a GymPass-style application built with **Node.js** for studying and practicing **SOLID principles** in a real-world context.  
It includes features such as:

- User registration and authentication
- Gym search and check-in functionality
- Check-in validation with geolocation rules
- Admin-only gym and check-in validation management
- JWT-based authentication and PostgreSQL data persistence

Perfect for applying clean architecture and solid software design patterns.
